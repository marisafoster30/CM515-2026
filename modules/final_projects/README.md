# Final Projects

Submission of a final project is worth 10% of the total course grade. Students should get approval for their chosen project before beginning. You are encouraged to utilize the many instructors of the course as mentors or advisors as you complete this project. Potential projects are offered below:

## Project Suggestion 1: Propose your own project

If none of the suggested projects listed below fit with what you would prefer to work on, you may propose your own project goals, scope, and submission criteria for approval.

## Project Suggestion 2: Explore an unknown gene

Select a gene of unknown function for a specific species. Using tools presented in class and available sequence data, reference genomes, and annotations, develop hypotheses for the possible function(s) of the selected gene (e.g. predicted structure, sequence homology, phylogenetic distribution, etc.). Submit all code and a brief writeup to summarize your findings and hypotheses. 

## Project Suggestion 3: Test the reproducibility of an existing publication

Find a peer-reviewed publication online or from your lab that has some computational component (data analysis, modeling, simulation, etc.) publicly available vie GitHub. Using only publicly accessible data, code, and documentation, attempt to reproduce some or all of the figures or results published in the paper. Submit a report that discusses the extent to which data and computational methods were easily accessible, how easy or hard it was to locate and follow their steps, and how well your results and/or figures match their published work. Discuss what the authors did well or poorly in terms of reproducibility, and briefly discuss what you will do in your own projects in the future to ensure your work is rigorous and reproducible. 

## More projects will be suggested by instructors as the semester continues
