# Week 2: Command Line
Instructors: Shady Kuster & Charli Geer

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this class, you should be able to:

- Explain the differences between a graphical user interface (GUI) and a command‑line interface, and describe why computational biologists rely heavily on the Unix shell.
- Define key command‑line terminology, including directory, file, command line, script, shell, Bash, prompt, and current working directory.
- Navigate a hierarchical directory structure using basic Bash commands, including moving between parent, child, and home directories.
- Identify your current working directory and interpret what it means in the context of file and command execution.
- Use core Bash commands (pwd, ls, cd, less, touch, mkdir, rm, man) to inspect, create, navigate, and manage files and directories.
- Apply basic command‑line syntax rules, including correct spelling, capitalization, spacing, and command execution.
- Interpret relative and shorthand path notation (., .., ~) when navigating the file system.
- Predict the effects of common commands on files and directories before running them.
- Explain why certain command‑line actions (e.g., file deletion with rm) behave differently from GUI-based workflows.
- Transfer concepts learned in a simulated environment (Terminus) to a real Unix shell.


## Why this matters:
Most computational biology tools—whether run locally, scripted in Bash, or executed on remote high‑performance computing systems—are accessed through the command line. Understanding how to navigate the file system and issue precise commands is a foundational skill for working with data, running analyses, and building reproducible workflows throughout this course and beyond.
